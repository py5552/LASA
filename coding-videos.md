# Coding videos

Welcome to my coding videos of my code `in Python` I recorded each video covering a separate `part of coding.` **These videos should help you learn how to code the basics of Python**.

## Absolute basics
These are what I determine to be **basics** and **include how to create a variable, how to setup code, and how to do operations**

For how to install Python go to python.org.

`````{admonition} Video

Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JugqYuQGQA"><b>here</b></a> to view a video I made to explain the basics.
`````

```{warning}
These videos might use skills from other areas such as `functions`.
```

`````{admonition} Video
:class: tip
<a href="https://youtu.be/3aKoNuIR0Ac"><b>Strings</b></a>

This video will show the *basics* of `strings` such as simple and multi-line strings. Also includes how to use ***`str()`***
`````



## Intermediate

`These cover more advanced topics such as booleans, if statements, and code that uses more than one aspect.`

`````{admonition} Video
:class: tip
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A_vRDSc3os"><b>Booleans</b></a>

Another <a href="https://youtu.be/DRw7_twSZKU"><b>Boolean</b></a> Video
`````
These videos will cover the *basics* of **booleans**.


`````{admonition} Video
:class: tip
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rriNurWOFA"><b>Time</b></a>
`````
This video will show you the *basics* of using **date** and **time**

I would ***recommend*** using jupyter notebook and visual studio code for this. **To install VS code go to code.visualstudio.com.** now open up the terminal and type **pip install jupyter notebook**,
when this is done type in **jupyter notebok**. Then go to your browser and you are good to go.

```{important}
I am using python 3.10
```
```{warning}
These vidoes will eventually be outdated
```

## Weird tech stuff

```{note}
These will include software (like jupyterbook) that doesn't fall into any category above.
