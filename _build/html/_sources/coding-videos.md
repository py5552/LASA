# Coding vidoes

Welcome to my coding videos of my code `in Python` I recored each video covering a seperate `part of coding.` **These video should help you learn how to code basics in Python**.

## Absolute basics
These are what I determine to be **basics** and **include how to create a variable, how to setup code, and how to do operations**

For how to install Python go to python.org.

I would recommened using jupyter notebook and visual studio code for this. **To install VS code go to code.visualstudio.com.** now open up the terminal and type **pip install jupyter notebook**,
when this is done type in **jupyter notebok**. Then go to your browser put in the link and you are good to go.
