# Coding videos

Welcome to my coding videos of my code `in Python` I recorded each video covering a separate `part of coding.` **These videos should help you learn how to code basics in Python**.

## Absolute basics
These are what I determine to be **basics** and **include how to create a variable, how to setup code, and how to do operations**

For how to install Python go to python.org.

`````{admonition} Video

Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM3vqrgG-eA"><b>here</b></a> to view a video I made to explain the basics.

*I tried to embed a video on to the page but it doesn't seem possible with JupyterBook.*

## Intermediate

`These cover more advanced topics such as booleans, if statements, and code that uses more than one apspect.`

I would ***recommend*** using jupyter notebook and visual studio code for this. **To install VS code go to code.visualstudio.com.** now open up the terminal and type **pip install jupyter notebook**,
when this is done type in **jupyter notebok**. Then go to your browser put in the link and you are good to go.
