# Coding videos

Welcome to my coding videos of my code `in Python` I recorded each video covering a separate `part of coding.` **These videos should help you learn how to code basics in Python**.

## Absolute basics
These are what I determine to be **basics** and **include how to create a variable, how to setup code, and how to do operations**

For how to install Python go to python.org.

These videos might use skills from other areas shuch as `functions`.

<a href="https://youtu.be/3aKoNuIR0Ac"><b>Strings</b></a>

This video will show the *basics* of `strings` such as simple and muli-line strings. Also includes how to use ***`str()`***
`````



## Intermediate

`These cover more advanced topics such as booleans, if statements, and code that uses more than one apspect.`

Another <a hrek="https://youtu.be/DRw7_twSZKU"><b>Boolean</b></a> Video

These videos will cover the *basics* of **booleans**.

`````
This video will show you the *basics* of using **date** and **time**

I would ***recommend*** using jupyter notebook and visual studio code for this. **To install VS code go to code.visualstudio.com.** now open up the terminal and type **pip install jupyter notebook**,
when this is done type in **jupyter notebok**. Then go to your browser and you are good to go.
