# Coding Problems
These coding problems are supposed to help you. Your **Goal** is to **fix** the code. Each problem will have some *`errors`* in it. You should *copy* and *paste* the code into your ***own editor*** and try to fix it. Each problem will relate to a video. Have Fun!

## If, elif, and else statments

This code is supposed to print *`yes`* if it's A, *`no`* if it's B, and *`maybe`* if it's neither.

```{code-cell}
def yes_or_no(x):
  if x == "A":
    return "yes"
  else:
    return "no"
  else:
    return "maybe"
```
```{tip}
Read the error message
```

## Strings
```{code-cell}
x = 10
print "I like ducks
I really like ducks
I really want " + x + " ducks"
```

```{important}
There can be more than one error
```
